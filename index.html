        <p>Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper). Before that, the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes). An ancient Japanese legend says if 
            you fold one thousand cranes you will be granted a wish.</p>
            <ol>There are more than a dozen National Origami Associations throughout the world.</ol>
   <ol>Akira Yoshizawa is considered the Grand Master of modern Origami. He created over 50,000 origami models, invented wet-folding, and developed a method of diagramming origami instructions.</ol>
     <ul>In Japan, origami has inspired a lot of art, fashion, food, and even architecture! If you visit, try to find all the buildings based on origami style. Hint: there’s a lot.</ul>  
<ul>The Guinness Book of World Records has dozens of entries for origami from most folds, to smallest and biggest and more! Can you guess the fastest time for folding 100 cranes?</ul>
